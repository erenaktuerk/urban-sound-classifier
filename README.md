Audio Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on building a machine learning model for audio classification tasks. The goal is to leverage deep learning techniques to process and classify audio data, with applications such as sound classification, speech recognition, and audio analysis.

Features
	•	Audio Classification: The model classifies audio files into predefined categories based on their content.
	•	Data Preprocessing: Comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline to handle audio data, including feature extraction such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).
	•	Model Architecture: Implementation of deep learning models using TensorFlow, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification.
	•	Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimization of hyperparameters for better model performance using grid search or randomized search.
	•	Evaluation Metrics: Use of relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) to assess model performance.
	•	Modular Codebase: The code is structured into multiple modules for easy maintenance and scalability:
	•	Data Preprocessing: Handle audio file loading, feature extraction, and normalization.
	•	Model Training: Implement training pipelines with custom neural networks or pre-trained models.
	•	Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using standard metrics.
	•	Utilities: Additional utility functions for visualization, saving models, etc.

Project Highlights
	•	State-of-the-Art Models: Leverages modern deep learning techniques such as CNNs for feature extraction and classification tasks.
	•	TensorFlow-Based: The project is built on TensorFlow, a powerful framework for deep learning that provides flexibility and scalability.
	•	Customizable: The model and preprocessing pipeline can be easily adapted for various audio classification tasks such as environmental sound classification or speech recognition.
